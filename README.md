## This is an eliteCons template made with Next.JS
### Your job is to give it a live, add relative image, icons and replace the dummy text with relevant text
### You have to host the images on imgbb, imggur or some other platform, and keep all the images in a single folder (not in the project folder) for future reference
### After completing the template, you have to show your team leader and then build on vercel, netlify or surge. You have to solve the build time error as well.

## The deadline is 29 January, 2025


- First fork the repository and then start the challenge.
- Run npm install and npm run start to see it on local server.
- Work smarter. Just use different images for home page. Otherwise use same sime image in multiple pages.
- If unnecessary (like user images), don't use images there, just let them as they are. Wishing you all the best.
